# Mentor Court Grant
In 2020, the St. Louis County Domestic Violence Court became the recipient of a “Mentor Court Technical Assistance” grant by the Department of Justice, Office on Violence against Women. As a result of the award, funds have been dedicated to help the St. Louis County Domestic Violence Court team provide advice, expertise and assistance to courts around the county with the primary goal of improving their domestic violence response.

## Purpose
A common request from administration and stakeholders at evolving courts is for academic evidence to support the changes being advocated for. To aid in this mission, the DV Court Grant Coordinator and several local university students compiled current best-practice research regarding civil domestic violence order of protections and its associated processes. Advocating for change within the justice system is a long process, we have created this database to support those advocates determined enough to try.

## Review Process
Every article contained within this database has been read, reviewed and recommended for inclusion. For user’s convenience, content readers have written a synopsis and three main points from each article. In addition, every one of these articles is either available for download from this database or is available via a link.
