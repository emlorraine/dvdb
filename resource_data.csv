City of Castle Rock. The author argues that the DeShaney case allowed for a claim on procedural due process with the state’s potential liability to protect as well as the opportunity for a “failure-to-protect” case. With this precedent, the paper discusses how the Gonzales case is helpful by leaving a foundation for victims of DV to have their OP enforcement requests checked and the ability to hold enough action against the police and state for refusing enforcement.",The DeShaney case recognized how procedural due process rights can support the rights of the victim in claiming the potential duty of the state to protect and the idea that a state’s “failure-to-protect” can be a constitutional violation.,The concern of an endless number of lawsuits being brought to the state was a main reason why dissenters in the Gonzales case did not want to expand state protective services under the 14th amendment.,Gonzales v. Castle Rock provided the foundation for DV victims to get their OP enforcement requests evaluated and hold enough action against the police and state for refusing enforcement of OPs.,Mattis- Protection Orders: A Procedural Pacifier (21)

New York is a good sample, as the domestic violence courts span across a large geographic area. After reviewing the literature, the authors matched samples of defendants processed in the 24 domestic violence courts in New York and in conventional courts operating under the same 24 jurisdictions and evaluated the outcomes of defendants. The authors found patterns based on court characteristics and policies, recidivism, and case processing and resolutions.","Among convicted offenders, domestic violence courts appeared to reduce re-arrest on any charge and significantly reduced re-arrest on domestic violence charges. These courts also significantly reduced the total number of re-arrests on both any charge and domestic violence charges.","Domestic violence courts that prioritize deterring re-offense and include measures created to sanction noncompliant offenders and to address victim safety and service needs significantly reduced re-arrest, as distinguished from domestic violence courts that focus less on those issues.",Domestic violence courts across New York significantly reduced average case processing time (197 vs. 260 days to disposition).,Cissner- Testing the Effect of New

The different domestic violence courts models are described and their benefits and downfalls are explained. The author finishes up by offering a step-by-step plan for new courts that are thinking of adding a domestic violence sector.,"A domestic violence court done wrong can negatively impact the court’s plan to keep victims safe and fail to hold perpetrators accountable, which is why it’s so important for DV courts to be done well.","Having specialized judges who understand dynamics of abuse are important because they become more personally invested, which leads to a better ability to issue consistent and effective rulings and a higher likelihood of following up on the case.","The model that would be the best place to start in developing a DV court is the Dedicated Civil Protection Order Docket, in which dockets only focus on civil protection orders.",Sack- Creating a Domestic Violence Court
